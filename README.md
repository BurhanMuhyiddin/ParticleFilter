# NOTE #
While Particle Filter library has been developed by me, the simulation code doesn't belong to me. I have just integrated my PF library into it for testing purposes. The simulation code has been developed by Steven Dumble. I have seen this simulation while following his beautiful Advanced Kalman Filter course in Udemy. Here is the link to the original repository: https://github.com/StevenDumble/AKFSF-Simulation-CPP
